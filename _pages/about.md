I am a PhD Student at Northeastern University, advised by Professor Jennifer Dy. My areas of research include interpretability, computer vision, and domain adaptation. 

I also offer one-on-one tutoring in both math and computer science. If you're interested in learning more, reach out to me through my email, which is linked on the left side of this page.
