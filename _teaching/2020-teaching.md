This course, titled "Probability, Statistics, and Data Science for Engineers" was offered to mostly Sophomore and Junior Engineering students. 

In my role as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, I held office hours in which students would seek help with their coursework. I was able to reinforce the topics covered in lecture as well as guide them towards the proper methodology for solving their homework problems.
