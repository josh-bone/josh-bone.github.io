As you may have seen from my other posts, I recently began privately tutoring. 
As a part of this process, I have begun compiling a collection of notes for the various topics which I teach. 
These notes are helpful for a few different uses:
- A reference for me
- A reference for my students
- A curriculum for future students

I've also decided to make them publicly available at their own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/josh-bone/Notes). 
Feel free to read them if you are trying to learn about any of these topics. 
These notes will be a persistent work in progress, and my hope is that one or two of them may even grow into books of their own.
